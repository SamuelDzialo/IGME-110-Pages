        <h1> Sam Dzialo IGME 110 Photoshop exercise </h1>
        <img src="magazine.jpg" alt="anime">
        <p>This picture is based off the popular anime magazine "Shonen Jump". This
        magazine has little text, with typically the only text on the magazine being the title.
        After recreating the background from a picture from the anime "Samuria Champloo"
        I inserted sword and turned it black and modified it. Afterwards I photoshoped the three characters
        and the symbol. I added the title and No.</p>
