            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I went to Shaker High School right outside of Albany, NY. Albany, NY has a lot of 
            great tech companies and these are what initially made me interested in pursuing a tech 
            related career. After talking a Computer Science class and networking based class in 
            High School I was even more sure that this was somthing that I wanted to do and that is when 
            I applied and got into RIT and have started trying to figure out what jobs I want to do in the 
            future. </p>
